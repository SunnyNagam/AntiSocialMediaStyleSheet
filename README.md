# AntiSocialMediaStyleSheet

Simple css style sheet that does the following:

  1.) Blocks out only the feed on your homepage in Facebook.
  
  2.) Makes Reddit more difficult to use by making every post take 4 seconds to load and make the text 
      so squished together that it's a little difficult to read.
      
Personally I find that if I block reddit entirely I envitably go back to it but making it annoying to use discorages me from using it
atleast 80% of the time.
